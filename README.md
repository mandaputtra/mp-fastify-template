# vf-cms
A CMS starter with vuejs and fastify (WIP)

This happen because i think every project are must have a CMS, but even I cant spell the right name of this project.

This project are still WIP and not open on contribution before the skeleton was ready. This would not be like stripe.io (they are great as hell), this will be like super simple cms that you can edit to the core without being confused. 

For the sake of learn I'll use fastify and vuejs together.

The roadmap :

### Front-end: 
  - [x] Login page
  - [ ] Admin page
  - [ ] Other than Admin page
  - [ ] Chart
  - [ ] User
    - [ ] User Permission
    - [ ] User CRUD
  - [ ] Menu
    - [ ] Menu Permission
    - [ ] Menu CRUD
  - [ ] Some other menu to provide example
  - [ ] Docs


### Back-end
  - [x] Implement fastify service per module
  - [x] Auth (login/register)
  - [ ] Scalable to the core
  - [ ] User permissions
  - [ ] Database setup
  - [ ] Provide ERD for the database
  - [ ] Provide API to front-end
  - [ ] Docs
    - [ ] Docs on scaling app (app must scale)
  - [ ] Websockets using primus.io
  
  Thanks hope i'll finish it as fast as I can
